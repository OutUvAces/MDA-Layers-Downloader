- For Python files: Always ensure changes pass basic syntax check.
- Suggest verification commands like:
  python -m py_compile downloaders/*.py
  or run the app/module to test.
- When dealing with description/Desc += strings: Keep them pure—never add generated <b> tags unless explicitly requested.
- Be thorough: If removing features (e.g., berth buffer notes), check both parser and generator files.
